  experimentDescriptionText:
  - "When the temperature of a material is changed, the size of an object made from
    the material also changes. This is caused by a change in the mean interatomic
    spacing due to a change in the amplitude of vibration of the atoms. In one dimension,
    the change in length, \u0394L. of an object is found to be approximately proportional
    to the original length, Lo, and also to the temperature change, \u0394T, where
    \u0394T = T - To. The proportionality can be expressed in equation form a "
  - "where \u03B1 is a constant known as the coefficient of linear expansion of the
    material. If (1) is solved for \u03B1, then"
  - "which represents the fractional change in length of the material per Celsius
    degree. This analysis can be extended to a two-dimensional object. Figure 1 shows
    a rectangular plate of length Lo and width W\u2092, at temperature T\u2092. The
    plate can be considered to be made up of thin horizontal rods of length Lo and
    of thin vertical rods of length W\u2092. When the temperature of the plate changes
    by \u0394T (= T - T\u2092), the length of the horizontal rods changes by \u0394L.
    and the vertical rods change by \u0394W. Thus the change in the area of the plate,
    \u0394A is found by subtracting the area at temperature T\u2092 from the area
    at temperature T."
